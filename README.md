# Sportify Data API Webscrape
This project is to use Spotify API endpoints to pull back personal user data.

## Table of Contents (Coming Soon)

## Description
"Spotify is a digital music, podcast, and video streaming service that gives you access to millions of songs and other content from artists all over the world." - [Spotify](https://support.spotify.com/us/using_spotify/getting_started/what-is-spotify/)

As an avid user of Spotify for over 10 year and a proud premium subscriber, I though it would be interesting to see my music taste/trends with the data that Spotify has on their back end. This project will be pulling my personal data from Spotify's API Endpoints and perform analysis on it. The project will also provide instruction on how you can pull your own Spotify data.

## Project Recap

## FAQ
**Q. What should I do when client script errors?**
<br/>
A. The UniCourt API could be potentially down; wait 1 hour and try again.
If this does not work, please contact Alex and Nick.
<br/>
<br/>
**Q. What happens if Trello notifies me that API endpoints are changing?**
<br/>
A. This will require repointing and testing.
All API points are covered in this documentation.
Updating of the endpoints and the retesting of the script will need to take place.
For assistance, contact Alex and Nick.
<br/>
<br/>
**Q. What happens if I were to delete the python script?**
<br/>
A. The script is centrally managed via GitHub, in which it tracks version control
and can be referenced to restore any scripts used for the project.
